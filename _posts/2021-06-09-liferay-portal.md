## The Liferay Development Team

Liferay Portal is produced by the worldwide Liferay engineering team, and
involves many hours of development, testing, writing documentation, and working
with the wider Liferay community of customers, partners, and open source
developers. We are glad you have chosen Liferay Portal, and hope that it meets
or exceeds your expectations!

In addition to Liferay's engineering staff, a special thanks goes to the many
open source developers who volunteer their time and energy to help with the
release, whether it was bug fixing, idea generation, documentation,
translations, or other contributions that helped to improve this release.
